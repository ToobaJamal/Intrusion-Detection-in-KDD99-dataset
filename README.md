# Intrusion-Detection-in-KDD99-dataset
A machine learning approach to intrusion detection in KDD99 dataset using machine learning algorithms in Python. Steps include
1. #Data Transformation: Label encoding and MinMax Scaling
2. #Feature Selection: Important feature selection using embedded method
3. #Model Building: Training Random Forest Classifiers, Decision Trees Classifiers, and K-nearest neighbors classifiers on training dataset and comparing accuracies of all three of them. Random Forest Classifiers and Decision Tree Classifier worked best.
