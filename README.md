# Intrusion-Detection-in-KDD99-dataset
A machine learning approach to intrusion detection in KDD99 dataset using machine learning algorithms in Python. Steps include

1.  ## Data Transformation: 
Label encoding and MinMax Scaling

2.  ## Feature Selection: 
Important feature selection using embedded method

3.  ## Model Building: 
Training Random Forest Classifiers, Decision Trees Classifiers, and K-nearest neighbors classifiers on training dataset and comparing accuracies of all three of them. Random Forest Classifiers and Decision Tree Classifier worked best.
